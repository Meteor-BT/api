# Meteor BT API

## Features:

1.  subpage of meteor-bt.com
2.  Hosted on VPS via NGINX (login required): 38.242.246.51
3.  Minimalist design, mirroring the feel (fonts, styling, colors) of this: https://app.corcel.io/chat; and this: https://taostats.io/
4.  Displays Figures and tables of weather forecasts vs actual weather. User selectable variables via dropdown.

    1.  User choice of Weather metric: Precipitation, Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed. From openmeteo.
    2.  User choice of time window
    3.  Map of Error (Actual - Forecasted), Actual, or Forecasted (choice) with a raster land mask. Ideal would be a rotating globe with city name callouts and error interpolated between cities, and city names displayed. More accessible would be a flat map projection of same (Goode’s Homolosine, or Winkel Tripel prpoojection). Designed to show the user a global view of the forecast error. Error should be averaged if the time window is more than 1 hour.
    4.  Graph of actual and forecast over time, by selectable city and time window
    5.  Graph of Error over time for selected variable. Goal is to show if error is changing over time. Probably use LOESS smoothing line overlaid on transparent points.

5.  Accessibility and security considerations: DB should allow insert from credentialized users - Will be a part of a decentralized ML project so will require write permissions from authorized users. Want to have this not compromise security, as much as possible.
6.  Website (not db) will be public, and not require credentials
7.  Forecast API should be available, API request form needed. Need to limit user requests based on key type: free, premium, and enterprise. Reasonable rates will be provided. Idea: pass though meteo API costs, or cost+
